Building a Python based Machine Learning application that takes in account blood tests which are thought to be sensitive to liver disorders that might arise from excessive alcohol consumption and compare with number of alcoholic beverages consumed per day.

Key Features
1. Working with UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets.
2. Complex medical problem statement solved using machine learning.
3. 4 supervised learning techniques used with extensive mathematical and graph comparison to yield the best solution.
4. Average Accuracy = 78.611%
5. User friendly console based application for users to predict whether they might be suffering from liver disease or not.
